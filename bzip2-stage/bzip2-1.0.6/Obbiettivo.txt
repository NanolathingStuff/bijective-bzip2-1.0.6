la proposta di stage consiste nel modificare una componente algoritmica di bzip2 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2), un compressore di dati.
In particolare quest'ultimo sfrutta la trasformata di Burrows-Wheeler 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform) che permuta i caratteri di una stringa per migliorare la compressione.

bzip2 is a free and open-source file compression program that uses the Burrows–Wheeler algorithm. It only compresses single files and is not a file archiver
bzip2 compresses most files more effectively than the older LZW (.Z) and Deflate (.zip and .gz) compression algorithms, but is considerably slower. LZMA is generally more space-efficient than bzip2 at the expense of even slower compression speed, while having much faster decompression.
Bzip2 uses several layers of compression techniques stacked on top of each other, which occur in the following order during compression and the reverse order during decompression:
Run-length encoding (RLE) of initial data
Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) or block sorting
Move to front (MTF) transform
Run-length encoding (RLE) of MTF result
Huffman coding
Selection between multiple Huffman tables
Unary base 1 encoding of Huffman table selection
Delta encoding (?) of Huffman code bit-lengths
Sparse bit array showing which symbols are used
